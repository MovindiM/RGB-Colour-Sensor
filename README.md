# RGB Colour Sensor

## Semester 2 Lab Project - GRP 14
Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering  
University of Moratuwa

Welcome to the RGB Colour Sensor project repository! This project focuses on designing and implementing a colour sensor capable of detecting the colour on a surface and providing its R, G, and B values. The sensor is based on the RGB model and can find applications in industrial, medical, and security systems.

## Project Overview

In this project, we aimed to develop a versatile colour sensor with the following features:

- **Calibration Stage:** The sensor includes a calibration stage to accommodate alterations in lighting conditions.

- **Modes:**
  - **Calibration Mode (a):** Allows the user to perform calibration at the beginning.
  - **Sensing Mode (b):** Enables the sensor to detect and output the R, G, and B values of the colour on a surface.
  - **LED Illumination Mode (c):** Lights up an RGB LED based on user-defined R, G, and B values.

## Getting Started

To get started with the RGB Colour Sensor, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RGB-Colour-Sensor.git
