# RGB-Colour-Sensor
Semester 2 lab project - GRP 14 at Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering - University of Moratywa

Colour sensors, mainly identified as true-colour or translucent index. These true colour sensors are based on one of the colour models, most commonly the RGB model, with a wide variety of applications in industrial, medical and security systems. In this project, we were expected to design and implement a colour sensor that can detect the colour on a surface and outputs its R, G, and B values.

We were allowed to have a calibration stage at the beginning. Our solution is able to handle alterations in lighting conditions. We have the following modes in our design.
(a) A mode to perform calibration
(b) A mode to perform sensing
(c) A mode to light a RBG LED for user given R, G, and B values.
